  <h1>FAQ</h1>

  <h3>Is downloading music from youtube legal?</h3>
  <p>Its in a legal gray area. You should ask yourself "How has yt-dlp been around all these years?". Basically, its up to you to use that feature properly. This is a hobby project of mine, if you decide to use the downloader feature for content that is not released under open licensing schemes, I can't be held accountable for that - its not my problem.</p>

  <h3>I can't play some files on windows. What do I do?</h3>
  <p>Most likely those codecs aren't installed on your system. Aurion uses system codecs for playback. You can try installing a codec pack like <a href="https://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K-Lite Codec Pack</a> to get more formats supported.</p>
