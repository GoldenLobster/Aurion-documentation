<h1>Roadmap</h1>

<p>My mind is all over the place. Whatever I come up with I will try to note down and put it here, but chances are that I might release new versions without really explaning whats new.</p>

<h2>Planned Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Smooth animation for the text(artist name and song name)</li>
  <li>new icons(volume and folder icons)</li>
  <li>Lyrics integration</li>
  <li>Making the settings an actual full tab instead of a little window</li>
  <li>while in another tab(like the settings tab for example) there will be a small control bar at the bottom of the screen</li>
  <li>Integrate the downloader into a tab instead of seperate window</li>
  <li>*once all the above is done the projects gui framework will be entirely pyqt5*</li>
  <li>Another addition to the downloader: having the ability to transfer playlists from another music service to youtube for easy downloading</li>
  <li>Making the downloader look more like the youtube music site(having recommendations, showing thumbnails, being able to pass cookies to see personalized recommendations, etc)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>

<p>We're constantly exploring new ideas to improve the user experience. Check back for updates as we continue to develop Aurion.</p>
